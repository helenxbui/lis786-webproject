<p><em>2022 Eisner Award Winner for Best Academic/Scholarly Work</em></p>

<p>Comics and the Origins of Manga: A Revisionist History was the 2022 Eisner Award Winner for Best Academic/Scholarly Work. It challenges the conventional wisdom that manga evolved from centuries of prior Japanese art and explains why manga and other comics around the world share the same origin story. The reality of manga history is that it is deeply intertwined with Japanâ€™s keen importation of Western technology and popular culture in the early twentieth century, and therefore manga should not be viewed as an exotic antithesis to American and European comics through an Orientalist framework. This book offers a new understanding of manga and how it became the way it is today.</p>

<p><em>Comics and the Origins of Manga: A Revisionist History</em> was the 2022 Eisner Award Winner for Best Academic/Scholarly Work. It challenges the conventional wisdom that manga evolved from centuries of prior Japanese art and explains why manga and other comics around the world share the same origin story. The reality of manga history is that it is deeply intertwined with Japanâ€™s keen importation of Western technology and popular culture in the early twentieth century, and therefore manga should not be viewed as an exotic antithesis to American and European comics through an Orientalist framework. This book offers a new understanding of manga and how it became the way it is today.</p>

<p><em>Manga: A Critical Guide</em>, by Shige (CJ) Suzuki and Ronald Stewart, is a wide-ranging introductory guide to manga, helping readers explore the diversity of Japanese comic styles, forms, and traditions from its earliest texts to the internationally popular comics of the 21st century. The book covers: the history of Japanese comics from its earliest forms to the present, case studies reflecting the range of themes, genres, forms, and creators, key themes and contexts ranging from gender and sexuality to history and censorship, and critical approaches to manga, with definitions, biographies, reception, and global publishing contexts.</p>

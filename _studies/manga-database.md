<p> The <em>Anime and Manga Studies Database</em> (<a href="https://www.animemangastudies.com/database/">link</a>) is a comprehensive searchable database of English-language scholarship on Japanese animation and comics written for professional audiences such as educators and librarians from the 1977 to 2024. Its online Annual Bibliography of Anime and Manga Studies serves as the backbone of the database, enabling users to search by publication, author, or book. Selected publications written before 2012 are also located in the older Online Bibliography of Anime and Manga Research website, which is no longer updated but remains as an archive. It also highlights announcements and news relevant to the anime and manga studies community, and provides commentary on new trends, new issues, and new publications. Outside resources are listed, such as blogs, scholars, and additional links. Its annual bibliography is useful to the intended audience of fans, students, scholars, and researchers who want to explore the field of anime and manga in a more academic manner.</p>

Its print edition is published annually. Both online and print editions are published by Fantagraphics Books. It was first launched in 1976 by Fantagraphics founders Gary Groth and J. Micheal Catron and became an avid advocate for conceptualizing comics as a legitimate art form through news, interviews, editorials, and comics criticism. It later went into a hiatus in 2013 but returned in 2019. It is related to the subject of manga because when performing a keyword search in the search bar for “manga” (https://www.tcj.com/?s=Manga), various manga reviews and articles show up in the results. Individual articles are accessible online, but archival issues require a print subscription for further access. This web resource is useful for educators, librarians, researchers, students, writers and comic enthusiasts who want to study and understand manga as an art medium.</p>

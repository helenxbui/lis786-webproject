<p><em>Reflections on Systems Analysis and Design</em></p>

<p>The two most important things that I learned in the EDU 779 course are the underlying process of creating process maps and wireframes, and how to use MS Lists and navigate Power Apps to integrate them to create a basic app.
This will be part of my future work as a librarian since they will be useful for instruction to patrons and staff while being relevant to my interest in UI/UX design.</p>

<p>I need to learn more about the workings of Power Apps such as the difference between a Canvas-type app and a Model-driven app and understand the Power Apps coding guidelines because while creating a simple canvas app is straight-forward,
model-driven apps are more complex, requiring stricter maintenance of code quality. I can learn more about Power Apps by using Microsoft LEARN trainings to work through the provided learning paths to build up my skills and knowledge in using
various Microsoft applications. </p>

<p><em>Reflections on Advanced Web Design</em></p>

<p>Learning more advanced concepts of web coding was a challenge, since it required me to go back and constantly review some of the concepts while ensuring that the LIS 786 project still adhered to the product vision statement.
   Sometimes I was successful, such as deleting redundant alt text captions, and other times I was not, such as trying to combine content from the about and index (formerly Welcome) pages into a single md file, but couldn't figure it out.
   I decided to modified the "Welcome" page to become the "Reflections" page to discuss the LIS courses I took for the Spring 2025 semester at Dominican University, since both mentioned courses required reflecting on the overall learning process.
